    ["Air is always around us. Moving air is called wind. When wind blows, it carries energy."],
    ["The wind’s energy can lift kites into the sky."],
    ["When something resists the wind’s movement, its energy can build up..."],
    ["before releasing in a violent burst."],
    ["But we can also capture the wind’s energy and change it into energy that we can use."],
    ["Turbines help us transform wind energy into electrical energy.", "The energy of moving air makes the blades of a wind turbine spin."],
    ["And the spinning blades change wind energy into electricity."],
    ["We can use this electricity long after the wind stops blowing."]
