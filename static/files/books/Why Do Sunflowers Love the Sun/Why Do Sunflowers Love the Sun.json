    ["Viveka wants to paint the sunflower field near her house. She looks at the sunflowers carefully one afternoon."],
    ["“I wonder why they are called sunflowers,” she says to Montu and Bontu. “Maybe it is because they look like the sun?”"],
    ["In the evening, Viveka takes Montu and Bontu outside to eat."],
    ["She watches the sunflowers in the distance swaying in the breeze. “Look!” she says to Billi, the cat, “The sunflowers look like they’re going to fall asleep, just like you!”"],
    ["Finally, Viveka sits down to paint. First she paints the sun high in the sky, just like it was in the afternoon.", "Then she paints the sunflowers with their heads looking down sleepily, like she saw them in the evening."],
    ["In the morning, Viveka goes to the sunflower field to check if her painting is correct. “Oh no,” she says, “I’ve painted them all wrong! I will have to do it again today.” “The sunflowers look like they are waking up,but the flowers in my painting look like they are falling asleep.”"],
    ["“This time, I will get it right!” Viveka tells Montu and Bontu. She goes out to the field at noon and makes a drawing of how the flowers look."],
    ["The next morning, Viveka runs to the field to check her new painting. “How can this be?” she cries. “Are these sunflowers full of mischief? Or is this magic?”"],
    ["Curious, Viveka climbs the tallest tree in her garden. “I’m going to watch their every move!”", "Over the next few days, Viveka observes the sunflowers carefully."],
    ["She paints them every day for a week. Then, on Sunday, she looks at all her paintings together."],
    ["Suddenly, she understands what the sunflowers have been doing. “It isn’t magic or a trick,” she says, smiling. “The sunflowers just love to follow the sun!”"]
